Implemented Functionality:
- Third Person Platformer: Implemented a character controller with camera-driven movement.
- Player Movement: Controlled via WASD with movement direction determined by the camera's orientation.
- Jumping: Basic jump functionality with double-jump support (grounded check and jump count management).
- Dash Feature: Activated via left shift, providing a temporary speed multiplier.
- Environment: Built with a ground plane, jumpable platforms, and invisible walls to prevent the player from falling out of bounds.
- Coin Collection: Coins are rotating collectibles that update the score via a GameManager upon player collision.
- Score UI: Score is displayed using TextMeshPro on a Canvas and updated in real time.
